## Motivation
After taking CS61 course, I started to appreciate the beauty of Scheme, and I became eager to explore its capabilities further. So I began to read the famous SCIP book and do exercises.

I use [DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/index.html) as the IDE to test my code. The explanation will be included in the comment if available.
